## Download

Download the latest `meccha-camouflage.exe` from GitHub Releases:

- https://github.com/acentrist/MecchaCamouflage/releases/latest

The EXE is self-contained. It does not need to be placed next to `PenguinHotel-Win64-Shipping.exe`; it finds the running game process by name.

## Usage

1. Start MECCHA CHAMELEON.
2. Start `meccha-camouflage.exe`.
3. Press `F10` in game.

## Logs

Logs and status files are written under:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\MecchaCamouflage\runtime\
```

Useful files:

- `events.jsonl`: structured runtime events.
- `runtime.log`: plain text runtime log.
- `last_status.json`: latest success or failure summary.
- `.progress.json`: transient bridge progress sidecar used by the controller.

If the game crashes after a MECCHA CHAMELEON update, the tracked SDK may need to be regenerated and reviewed.

## Development

Use Windows with Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools. PowerShell 7 is recommended.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/acentrist/MecchaCamouflage.git
cd MecchaCamouflage
make build
```

The development EXE is generated at:

```text
.build/bin/meccha-camouflage.exe
```

To run the controller from the repo:

```bash
make run
```

The default development mode is configured at the top of `Makefile`.
`make build`, `make run`, and `make package` wrap `scripts/build.ps1`,
`scripts/dev.ps1`, and `scripts/release.ps1`.

## Runtime SDK Resolution

The runtime resolves the global object/name tables at startup and uses the
minimal declarations in `runtime/sdk/meccha_sdk_min.hpp`. Generated SDK output
is not part of this repository. If a game update breaks runtime
reflection or a field layout, update the minimal runtime declarations directly.
