# p/native route policy

## Multi-first routes

| Route | Status | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `front_atlas_paint_stream` | Adopted default | Build the CPU texture atlas, then apply it through replicated `ServerPaintBatch`. No texture import is allowed. |
| `front_sample_paint_stream` | Explicit paint route | Debug/sample paint stream using replicated paint API only. |
| `front_metallic_texture_paint_stream` | Explicit paint route | Metallic/base experiment that still applies through replicated paint API only. |
| `texture_atlas_paint_api_stream` | Explicit paint route | Full atlas experiment through replicated paint API only. |
| `texture_sync_strict_probe` | Candidate probe | The only route allowed to call `ImportChannelFromBytes`; it must immediately dispatch runtime texture sync RPC candidates. |
| `cpu_mesh_raycast`, `cpu_mesh_probe_only`, `cpu_mesh_texture_paint_stream` | Gated candidates | CPU mesh/raycast work must not use memory-scan fallback or local texture import. |

## Removed local-only routes

The following routes are intentionally removed from CLI/default dispatch because they mutate only local texture state and do not prove multiplayer behavior:

- `texture_import_diagnostic`
- `texture_color_transfer_probe`
- `front_metallic_texture_import_diagnostic`
- `metallic_base_then_front_texture_import_diagnostic`
- `cpu_mesh_texture_import_diagnostic`

## Hard rules

- Default F10 must use `front_atlas_paint_stream`.
- `ImportChannelFromBytes` is forbidden except inside `texture_sync_strict_probe`.
- `texture_sync_strict_probe` must fail before local import when no sync RPC is available.
- Local-only import, material swap, synthetic UV placement, and memory-scan fallback are forbidden.
- Texture artifacts such as `atlas_preview.ppm`, `import_bytes_preview.ppm`, `coverage_mask.pgm`, and `rgb_stats.json` may be produced for debugging without mutating game state.
- Remote multiplayer success requires a remote peer observation; local import or local hash change is not sufficient.
